Where **ideas**, **tasks** and **issues** have the next columns structure (only **ideas** has "In review" instead of "In process")  
TO-DOs --> In process --> Completed || Postponed  
![image](https://github.com/hadabr/assets/blob/master/working-enviroment-setup/sams.png?raw=true)  
where 1st column always as a storage, 2nd means an action.
**Postponed** - as here is used a simpler approach than Scrum, it means, the flow has no iterations and reminds a timeline arrow - proposals still can be postponed on "*ideas*" level, on "*task*" or even be "*blocked*" for a time.
An example lifecycle of a task from a proposal to final product:

__  
*be sure, that **blocked** will not appear on your Calendar  
it can be set as non-tracking board or board that contains only "completed" column, which will not appear in the calendar
