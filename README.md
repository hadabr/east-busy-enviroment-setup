### Easy frontend framework setup
for small teams and open source projects
#### Project and time management
##### Task management
```Tool:``` [*Trello, quire, Asana or Jira etc.*]  
```Patterns:``` Kanban-based pattern  
```-``` main workflow is split into ```ideas```, ```tasks``` and ```issues``` boards by default; also, ```common``` and ```blocked``` lists

```-``` boards follow columns template: 
TO-DOs &nbsp;⇒&nbsp; In process &nbsp;⇒&nbsp; Completed &nbsp;*or*&nbsp; Postponed

As here is a simpler approach than Scrum - we have a *non-iterative* one-dimensional flow. Anyway, tasks still can be _postponed_ or *blocked* for a time and reopen later.  

```-``` tasks are moved between boards changing their status

__  
*be sure, that **blocked** will not appear on your Calendar  
it can be set as non-tracking board or board that contains only "completed" column, which will not appear in the calendar
