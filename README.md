the flow is split by default into several boards

Where **ideas**, **tasks** and **issues** have the next columns structure (only **ideas** has "In review" instead of "In process")
TO-DOs --> In process --> Completed || Postponed

where 1st column always as a storage, 2nd means an action  
**Postponed** - as here is used a simpler approach than Scrum, it means, the flow has no iterations and reminds a timeline arrow - proposals still can be postponed on "*ideas*" level, on "*task*" or even be "*blocked*" for a time 
The whole lifecycle of a proposal:

*be sure, that **blocked** will not appear
