### Easy frontend framework setup
for small teams and open source projects
#### Project and time management
##### Task management
```Tool:``` [*Trello, quire, Asana or Jira etc.*]  
```Patterns:``` Kanban-based pattern
main working flow is split by default into several boards

```ideas```, ```tasks``` and ```issues``` follow the next columns structure: 
TO-DOs &nbsp;⇒&nbsp; In process &nbsp;⇒&nbsp; Completed &nbsp;*or*&nbsp; Postponed  
(only ```ideas``` has "In review" instead of "In process")    
![image](https://github.com/hadabr/assets/blob/master/working-enviroment-setup/sams.png?raw=true)  
TO-DOs / 1st column - tasks storage.  
In process/ 2nd - an action.  
Here is a simpler approach than Scrum, we have non-iterative flow, but tasks still can be _postponed_ on ```ideas``` / ```task``` level; or even be "*blocked*" for a time.  

An example lifecycle of a task from a proposal to final product:

__  
*be sure, that **blocked** will not appear on your Calendar  
it can be set as non-tracking board or board that contains only "completed" column, which will not appear in the calendar
